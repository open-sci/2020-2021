The purpose of this work is to find an automated process to repair invalid DOIs that have been collected by the OpenCitations Index Of Crossref Open DOI-To-DOI References (COCI) while processing data provided by Crossref. This data is provided by COCI as a CSV list containing invalid cited DOIs. Our goal is to find classes of errors that characterize the wrong DOIs in the list. Our starting hypothesis is that there are two main classes of errors: factual errors, such as wrong characters, and DOIs that are not yet valid at the time of processing. The first class can be furtherly divided into errors due to forbidden characters, such as whitespaces, errors due to irrelevant strings added to the beginning or end of the correct DOI, or human-made errors. Once the classes of errors are addressed, we propose automatic processes to obtain correct DOIs from wrong ones. These processes involve the use of structured and unstructured information returned from DOI and Crossref APIs, as well as rule-based methods to correct invalid DOIs. As a result of the research, we are going to estimate how many correct DOIs and, therefore, citations are obtained. Finally, we are going to discuss possible drawbacks of our methods and further developments that can be made.
