    "<p>Today I started working on the problem of wrong DOI names reported by Crossref. In particular, the research question on which the entire work focuses is which are the classes of errors that characterize the invalid DOI names and which classes can be addressed through automatic processes in order to obtain the correct DOI names.<p/>\n",
    "<p>Having never used the DOI API, I explored the subject by reading its documentation<sup><a href=\"#preliminary_ref_01\">[1]</a></sup>. In particular, in chapter <em>3.8.3 Proxy Server REST API</em> I discovered that by performing a GET to https://doi.org/api/handles/&lt;doi&gt; it is possible to obtain useful information in response. Among these, the status code is particularly interesting, which can take on four values:\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>1: Success. (HTTP 200 OK)</li>\n",
    "    <li>2: Error. Something unexpected went wrong during handle resolution. (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error)</li>\n",
    "    <li>100: Handle Not Found. (HTTP 404 Not Found)</li>\n",
    "    <li>200: Values Not Found. The handle exists but has no values (or no values according to the types and indices specified). (HTTP 200 OK)</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "This is extremely useful for identifying those initially invalid DOI names that have become valid in the meantime.</p>\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>Together with my colleagues Cristian Santini (orcid: 0000-0001-7363-6737), Ricarda Boente (orcid: 0000-0002-2133-8735) and Deniz Tural (orcid: 0000-0002-6391-4198) I wrote the first version of the abstract.</p>\n",
    "<p>Starting from the initial hypothesis that there are two classes of errors, namely factual errors and DOI names that are not yet valid at the time of processing, we tried to further break down the first class into various subclasses: exploring the input dataset, we hypothesized that a DOI name may be factually wrong because it contains forbidden characters, because it contains excess strings at the beginning or at the end or due to a human error in the transcription.</p>\n",
    "<p>Moreover, I have elaborated a first hypotheses on how to deal with both errors' classes. As for the first class, I speculated that it would be possible to obtain the correct cited DOI names starting from the valid citing DOI names, using the REST API for COCI: to obtain through the COCI references operation all the cited articles and, using word embeddings algorithm, to identify the most similar DOI name to the wrong one. However, my colleagues have rightly pointed out that wrong DOI names are not accepted by COCI and that COCI is built from Crossref, so it would not be possible to get the correct DOI names from COCI. Another hypothesis proposed by Cristian was to exploit other metadata provided by Crossref relating to that particular wrong DOI name to check if there are other DOI names connected to it, which perhaps refer to the correct one. Finally, it was decided to remain as vague as possible in the abstract and to summarize the various hypotheses formulated in the expression \"rule-based methods\" with the idea of defining this point after further research.<p/>\n",
    "<p>Instead, there has been much more consensus on the strategy for dealing with the second class of errors, namely those due to DOI names that are not yet valid, that is, use the DOI API by interpreting the response status code.</p>"

    "\n",
    "<p>Writing the abstract raised some questions about the specifics of a DOI name. Therefore, I decided to read the entire documentation with the aim of answering three questions:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Do DOI names use a limited character set?</li>\n",
    "    <li>Do DOI names have semantics?</li>\n",
    "    <li>In which ways can I query the DOI System Proxy Server?</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>Chapter <em>2.5.1 Encoding principle</em> answers the first question:</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\"DOI names may incorporate any printable characters from the Universal Character Set (UCS-2), of ISO / IEC 10646, which is the character set defined by Unicode. The character set encompasses most characters used in every major language written today. However, because of specific uses made of certain characters by some Internet technologies (the use of pointed brackets in xml for example), there may some effective restrictions in day-to-day use.\"</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>Chapter <em>2.2.1 General characteristics</em> answers the second question:</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>The DOI name is an opaque string for the purposes of the DOI system. No definitive information may be inferred from the specific character string of a DOI name. In particular, the inclusion in a DOI name of any registrant code allocated to a specific registrant does not provide evidence of the ownership of rights or current management responsibility of any intellectual property in the referent. Such information may be asserted in the associated metadata.</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>As for the third question, chapter <em>3.8.4.2 Parameter Passing</em> explores a series of queries that can be performed to specify the desired output. Therefore, I hypothesized that among the wrong DOI names there could be some that, during the extraction phase, had not been deprived of the query portion. The hypothesis was confirmed. The code used to perform this check is shown below.</p>"

    "## 09/04/2021 Literature review <a name=\"literature\"></a>\n",
    "<p>Taking a cue from Cristian's laboratory notebook, I read the articles he reported on 09/04/2021 about past studies on our research topic. I found several interesting ideas in <em>Types of DOI errors of cited references in Web of Science with a cleaning method</em><sup><a href=\"#literature_ref_01\">[1]</a></sup> by Shuo Xu et al. :</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The study suggests that there are three types of DOI errors, namely prefix-, suffix- and other-type errors. The other-type errors are further divided into three subgroups: (a) those containing special characters (such as 10.1034/j.1600-0404.2000.101004262x./), (b) incoherently described DOIs (such as 10.1038/), and (c) those with incomplete suffix but with correct DOI prefix (such as 10.1007/3-540-48194-X_).</li>\n",
    "    <li>Three regular expressions are proposed to clean up the respective types of errors.\n",
    "        <img src=\"https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11192-019-03162-4/MediaObjects/11192_2019_3162_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp\"/>\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned regular expressions are applied to strings already cleaned of double underscores, double periods, XML tags, spaces and forward slashes.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>Finally, the article mentions some problems that cannot be solved by this approach: (a) similar characters confused with each other, such as “O” versus “0”, “b” versus “6” and “O” versus “Q”; (b) to distinguish the correct DOI name from multiple DOI names assigned to the same cited reference; (c) a DOI name assigned to some cited reference that cannot be resolved by the DOI system; (d) a DOI name that is resolvable, but points to some knowledge unit within the interested cited reference.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Also, the article <em>DOI errors and possible solutions for Web of Science</em> by Juenwen Zhu et al.<sup><a href=\"#literature_ref_02\">[2]</a></sup> suggests that DOI names often contain the wrong characters for similarity to the right ones, such as \"O\" instead of \"0\", \"b\" instead of \"6\", \"O\" instead of \"Q\". A possible solution could then be to apply these replacements and verify the new DOI is resolved by the DOI System Proxy.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, the paper <em>Errors in DOI indexing by bibliometrics databases</em> by Fiorenzo Franceschini et al.<sup><a href=\"#literature_ref_03\">[3]</a></sup> reports a more generic classification of bibliographic database errors, i.e. it distinguishes between authors' errors in creating the list of cited resources, and database mapping errors, such as transcription errors. It is clear that our work focuses only on the second category. The article then proceeds with analyzing a further category of error, i.e. single DOI names associated with different papers. However, no solution is proposed to the problem, which is only highlighted.</p>\n",
