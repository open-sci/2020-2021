    "<p>Today I started working on the problem of wrong DOI names reported by Crossref. In particular, the research question on which the entire work focuses is which are the classes of errors that characterize the invalid DOI names and which classes can be addressed through automatic processes in order to obtain the correct DOI names.<p/>\n",
    "<p>Having never used the DOI API, I explored the subject by reading its documentation<sup><a href=\"#preliminary_ref_01\">[1]</a></sup>. In particular, in chapter <em>3.8.3 Proxy Server REST API</em> I discovered that by performing a GET to https://doi.org/api/handles/&lt;doi&gt; it is possible to obtain useful information in response. Among these, the status code is particularly interesting, which can take on four values:\n",
    "<ul>\n",

    "    <li>2: Error. Something unexpected went wrong during handle resolution. (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error)</li>\n",
    "    <li>100: Handle Not Found. (HTTP 404 Not Found)</li>\n",
    "    <li>200: Values Not Found. The handle exists but has no values (or no values according to the types and indices specified). (HTTP 200 OK)</li>\n",

    "<p>Together with my colleagues Cristian Santini (orcid: 0000-0001-7363-6737), Ricarda Boente (orcid: 0000-0002-2133-8735) and Deniz Tural (orcid: 0000-0002-6391-4198) I wrote the first version of the abstract.</p>\n",
    "<p>Starting from the initial hypothesis that there are two classes of errors, namely factual errors and DOI names that are not yet valid at the time of processing, we tried to further break down the first class into various subclasses: exploring the input dataset, we hypothesized that a DOI name may be factually wrong because it contains forbidden characters, because it contains excess strings at the beginning or at the end or due to a human error in the transcription.</p>\n",
    "<p>Moreover, I have elaborated a first hypotheses on how to deal with both errors' classes. As for the first class, I speculated that it would be possible to obtain the correct cited DOI names starting from the valid citing DOI names, using the REST API for COCI: to obtain through the COCI references operation all the cited articles and, using word embeddings algorithm, to identify the most similar DOI name to the wrong one. However, my colleagues have rightly pointed out that wrong DOI names are not accepted by COCI and that COCI is built from Crossref, so it would not be possible to get the correct DOI names from COCI. Another hypothesis proposed by Cristian was to exploit other metadata provided by Crossref relating to that particular wrong DOI name to check if there are other DOI names connected to it, which perhaps refer to the correct one. Finally, it was decided to remain as vague as possible in the abstract and to summarize the various hypotheses formulated in the expression \"rule-based methods\" with the idea of defining this point after further research.<p/>\n",
    "<p>Instead, there has been much more consensus on the strategy for dealing with the second class of errors, namely those due to DOI names that are not yet valid, that is, use the DOI API by interpreting the response status code.</p>"

    "\n",
    "<p>Writing the abstract raised some questions about the specifics of a DOI name. Therefore, I decided to read the entire documentation with the aim of answering three questions:\n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>Do DOI names use a limited character set?</li>\n",
    "    <li>Do DOI names have semantics?</li>\n",
    "    <li>In which ways can I query the DOI System Proxy Server?</li>\n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "<p>Chapter <em>2.5.1 Encoding principle</em> answers the first question:</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>\"DOI names may incorporate any printable characters from the Universal Character Set (UCS-2), of ISO / IEC 10646, which is the character set defined by Unicode. The character set encompasses most characters used in every major language written today. However, because of specific uses made of certain characters by some Internet technologies (the use of pointed brackets in xml for example), there may some effective restrictions in day-to-day use.\"</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>Chapter <em>2.2.1 General characteristics</em> answers the second question:</p>\n",
    "<blockquote>The DOI name is an opaque string for the purposes of the DOI system. No definitive information may be inferred from the specific character string of a DOI name. In particular, the inclusion in a DOI name of any registrant code allocated to a specific registrant does not provide evidence of the ownership of rights or current management responsibility of any intellectual property in the referent. Such information may be asserted in the associated metadata.</blockquote>\n",
    "<p>As for the third question, chapter <em>3.8.4.2 Parameter Passing</em> explores a series of queries that can be performed to specify the desired output. Therefore, I hypothesized that among the wrong DOI names there could be some that, during the extraction phase, had not been deprived of the query portion. The hypothesis was confirmed. The code used to perform this check is shown below.</p>"

    "<p>Taking a cue from Cristian's laboratory notebook, I read the articles he reported on 09/04/2021 about past studies on our research topic. I found several interesting ideas in <em>Types of DOI errors of cited references in Web of Science with a cleaning method</em><sup><a href=\"#literature_ref_01\">[1]</a></sup> by Shuo Xu et al. :</p>\n",
    "<ul>\n",
    "    <li>The study suggests that there are three types of DOI errors, namely prefix-, suffix- and other-type errors. The other-type errors are further divided into three subgroups: (a) those containing special characters (such as 10.1034/j.1600-0404.2000.101004262x./), (b) incoherently described DOIs (such as 10.1038/), and (c) those with incomplete suffix but with correct DOI prefix (such as 10.1007/3-540-48194-X_).</li>\n",
    "    <li>Three regular expressions are proposed to clean up the respective types of errors.\n",
    "        <img src=\"https://media.springernature.com/full/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1007%2Fs11192-019-03162-4/MediaObjects/11192_2019_3162_Fig2_HTML.png?as=webp\"/>\n",
    "It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned regular expressions are applied to strings already cleaned of double underscores, double periods, XML tags, spaces and forward slashes.\n",
    "    </li>\n",
    "    <li>Finally, the article mentions some problems that cannot be solved by this approach: (a) similar characters confused with each other, such as “O” versus “0”, “b” versus “6” and “O” versus “Q”; (b) to distinguish the correct DOI name from multiple DOI names assigned to the same cited reference; (c) a DOI name assigned to some cited reference that cannot be resolved by the DOI system; (d) a DOI name that is resolvable, but points to some knowledge unit within the interested cited reference.</li>\n",
    "</ul>\n",
    "<p>Also, the article <em>DOI errors and possible solutions for Web of Science</em> by Juenwen Zhu et al.<sup><a href=\"#literature_ref_02\">[2]</a></sup> suggests that DOI names often contain the wrong characters for similarity to the right ones, such as \"O\" instead of \"0\", \"b\" instead of \"6\", \"O\" instead of \"Q\". A possible solution could then be to apply these replacements and verify the new DOI is resolved by the DOI System Proxy.</p>\n",
    "<p>Finally, the paper <em>Errors in DOI indexing by bibliometrics databases</em> by Fiorenzo Franceschini et al.<sup><a href=\"#literature_ref_03\">[3]</a></sup> reports a more generic classification of bibliographic database errors, i.e. it distinguishes between authors' errors in creating the list of cited resources, and database mapping errors, such as transcription errors. It is clear that our work focuses only on the second category. The article then proceeds with analyzing a further category of error, i.e. single DOI names associated with different papers. However, no solution is proposed to the problem, which is only highlighted.</p>\n",

For this reason, I imagine the GPL is less popular than the other licenses, as it restricts the potential users of the software.

    "## 30/04/2021 Public Data File from Crossref <a name=\"crossref_dump\"></a>\n",
    "\n",
    "<p>The main difficulty of this research is certainly in the management of the large amount of requests to the DOI Proxy Server, which is complex both in terms of execution stability and in terms of the time it is necessary to wait before obtaining a result. If a request is made per second (which is not the case, because many DOIs are wrong and the timeout has been set to 10 seconds), it takes 1'200'000 seconds to process 1'200'000 DOIs, which corresponds to 20'000 minutes, or 13 days and 21 hours. The cache doesn't help reduce the time from the second run onwards either, because the cache only saves the correct results, the ones that received an HTTP 200 OK response, while the 404s, which are the most, need to be repeated.</p>\n",
    "<p>However, there is a way to dramatically reduce the execution time, which is to use the Crossref dump. The DOIs present at the \"work\" level in Crossref are assigned by Crossref itself and, therefore, are necessarily correct, unlike those at the \"reference\" level, which are instead assigned by publishers and which this work intends to verify and correct.</p>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, I downloaded all Crossref via BitTorrent from the following address <a href=\"https://doi.org/10.13003/GU3DQMJVG4\" target=\"_blank\" alt=\"Crossref dump link\">https://doi.org/10.13003/GU3DQMJVG4</a>, which took about 8 hours. The uncompressed file weighs over half a TB and consists of over 40,000 json files. Then, I wrote an algorithm to parse them all and save only the DOIs at work level in a csv file. However, I was unable to process all of Crossref, as the process is clearly very demanding in terms of RAM, and I was able to generate a CSV file corresponding to only half of Crossref. Note: The computer that was used has 32 GB of RAM. In order to make this process more efficient, I chose to use the ijson library,which instead of loading each json file, reads them as a stream, responding only to specific events, similar to what SAX does for XML.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output CSV file was later used to generate a set containing all DOIs. The set and not the list was chosen because the complexity of the control operation if an element is contained within it is O(1), while for a list it is O(n). In other words, for a set it is instantaneous, while for a list the time required is directly proportional to the number of elements in the list, which in this case is millions of DOIs. The reason is that the elements in a set are hashed, which requires even more RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "After that, the algorithm was modified to check if each DOI is present in the set before making a request to the DOI Proxy Server. A substantial improvement in speed was observed. However, the occupied RAM was 21 GB. Therefore, I decided to make the import of DOIs from Crossref as an optional step, leaving the user the possibility to choose whether to favor execution times or RAM.\n",

    "During the presentation of the results on 05/05/2021, our work received some useful criticism. Among those is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<blockquote>You said that it is pretty impossible that the process stop to compute the various values. But what does it happen if someone by accident switch off your computer while running the computation? Do you have a way to restart it from the last data produced, avoiding to start it again from the beginning?</blockquote>\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed it is true, if the PC were to shut down the entire work (except for the cache of requests to the DOI Proxy server) would be lost. In order to deal with this problem, I have implemented a new support method, <strong>read_cache</strong>, which if a cache file has been created, reads the data processed up to that moment, in order to restart from the last CSV line read and not from the beginning. This function has been integrated in both check_dois_validity and procedures, that create or update a cache file every n DOIs. The number of DOIs after which to update the cache is customizable, as is the location of the cache file.\n",

    "The comparison to the reference study made by Xu et al (2019) shows that the methods used in this research were able to clean more DOIs overall. However, which could be seen as surprising, applying the methods from Xu et al, 17,395 more suffix errors could be cleaned, while the number of prefix errors in the given dataset according to them results to zero. This result can be explained taking a closer look at the regular expressions and the definition of prefix- and suffix-type errors used by Xu et al. In the study presented here, the regular expression for prefix errors was a bit broader, as it also included different strings before the two possible DOI Proxy Server URLs, while Xu et al. only matched DOIs beginning with exactly those URLs, which, in the given dataset by Peroni (2021), results to 0 matches. The higher number of cleaned suffix errors using the methods by Xu et al can be explained by the same reason. As the algorithm presented here checks a DOI name subsequently for prefix, then suffix and in the end other-type errors, the errors not catched as prefix errors in the first place, can still be cleaned as suffix errors in the next step. Presumably, the mentioned type of error was fixed as suffix error with the regular expression, which lead to the higher number."
