I continued the search following the cited references that seemed to contain information about error classes occuring in DOI names and (automatic) methods for fixing and cleaning the DOIs. Especially Xu, S., Hao, L., An, X. et al. Types of DOI errors of cited references in Web of Science with a cleaning method. Scientometrics 120, 1427â€“1437 (2019). https://doi.org/10.1007/s11192-019-03162-4 (which we already found before) seems to be useful."
