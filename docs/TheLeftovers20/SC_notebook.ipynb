    "After reviewing the slides and getting to know the OpenCitations project a little more, and learning the correct way to write a project abstract from [the guide from Emerald publishing offered in the course slides](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/how-to/authoring-editing-reviewing/write-article-abstract), we commenced writing the abstract for our project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/open-sci/2020-2021/blob/master/docs/TheLeftovers20/abstract.md). It was a challenging step, because we had to think about our project consciously and meticulously before having started getting our hands dirty."

    "During and after the class of 01/04/2021 (some of us were not present during the final hour because of a previously set exam) we created ORCID IDs for the group members. Afterwards, in the days preceding the lesson of the 8th, we created the Data Management Plan using the [OpenAIRE Argos Website](http://argos.openaire.eu/). We wrote the main explanations of the project all together in a group video call, and divided ourselves into two groups for inserting the data for each dataset. Arianna and I put in the data for the dataset relating to the output data (titled _Missing Citations in COCI_). We all read some data on lesser-known fields to us such as licenses during the video call together.\n",

    "After the clarifications made in the 8 April class, we started our individual Jupyter Notebooks (almost identical up to this point since we did everything together, but not necessarily so in the future) in a diary format and also we updated the FAIR part of the DMP based on our new knowledge of the metadata solutions available in Zenodo. Now we have a [new version of the DMP](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.4704464). We also divided in two groups to carry out two different tasks: the bibliographic research (me and Alessia) and the analysis of COCI software (Arianna and Nooshin) in order to have a complete overview on what to write in the protocol."

    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, we also started querying Crossref API service with some sample DOIs, so to be able to make some considerations about the amount and the quality of data we are going to extract information from. During this step, we realised that the two alternative ways we worked out to retrieve information about publisher given a DOI seem to be in contrast. In particular, we noticed that - starting from a same DOI - the publisher that could be traced back to from the firs six characters of the identifier was not the same retrievable from the response of the Crossref API request. For this reason, we decided to ask for clarifications before proceeding."

    "At this point, we concretely structured the protocol for our workflow. For a matter of computational order, we preferred to address first the third research question (i.e. the one related to the previously invalid DOIs which can nowadays be re-labelled as valid). In relation to this point, we discussed how to manage the invalid_dois.csv file after this step, and whether the citations with now valid cited DOIs were supposed to be included in the further steps of the research, where we plan to identify publishers of both citing and cited DOIs. In order to find an optimal balance between computational cost and preservation of information that could be potentially useful for further analysis based on data we are handling, we decided to discuss this aspect with the course Professor Silvio Peroni before proceeding.\n",
    "In the end, we decided to structure the protocol ([Investigating Invalid DOIs in COCI](https://www.protocols.io/view/investigating-invalid-dois-in-coci-bt5xnq7n)) in the following listed points:\n",
    "1.  \tReading CSV data\n",
    "2.  \tCreation of the output JSON file\n",
    "3.     Processing of each CSV file line and extraction of required information and differentiation of the further management of still invalid and now valid DOIs.\n",
    "4.  \tExtraction of data about publishers for both citing and cited articles from their DOIs and management of the case in which the first 6 characters are not a valid ID\n",
    "5.  \tReturn of the completed JSON file after processing all the lines\n",
    "Further, we contemplate the idea to add a further CSV file to store the retrieved information, to enable additional research on the produced material.\n",
    "For this week we kept working mostly collegially, since we agreed that everyone of us should have a broad comprehension of all the aspects of the workflow before splitting it more markedly in the next phases. However,  I especially worked on the preliminary phase of selection of relevant publications to create a well-documented protocol, and then I also focused on its effective implementation with Nooshin, in light of collegial consideration about the way in which the workflow steps could be divided."

    "Having to produce a review of the Data Management Plan carried out by Grasshoppers group on their research, I have read some relevant papers to better understand how to carry out and structure a review, and especially a review for this kind of publication. Selected resources are:\n",

    "3. The guidelines to assist reviewers in reviewing such scholarly resources provided by the International Semantic Web Conference series: https://iswc2021.semanticweb.org/resources-track.\n",

    "While the first one is specifically thought for producing appropriate reviews of Data Management Plans, the second one has been a useful resource to have a better understanding of what is an open peer review in the Open Science environment; and useful were also the several reviews provided with the article itself, which allowed me to have an idea about all the possible structures a review can have. The last one helped me to retrieve relevant topics to take into account in a review of a scholarly resource in general, regardless of the type of the resource itself.\n",
