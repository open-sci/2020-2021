    "After reviewing the slides and getting to know the OpenCitations project a little more, and learning the correct way to write a project abstract from [the guide from Emerald publishing offered in the course slides](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/how-to/authoring-editing-reviewing/write-article-abstract), we commenced writing the abstract for our project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/open-sci/2020-2021/blob/master/docs/TheLeftovers20/abstract.md). It was a challenging step, because we had to think about our project consciously and meticulously before having started getting our hands dirty."

    "During and after the class of 01/04/2021 (some of us were not present during the final hour because of a previously set exam) we created ORCID IDs for the group members. Afterwards, in the days preceding the lesson of the 8th, we created the Data Management Plan using the [OpenAIRE Argos Website](http://argos.openaire.eu/). We wrote the main explanations of the project all together in a group video call, and divided ourselves into two groups for inserting the data for each dataset. Alessia and I put in the data for the dataset relating to the code (titled _Code for Missing Citations Analysis in COCI_). We all read some data on lesser-known fields to us such as licenses during the video call together.\n",
