    "After reviewing the slides and getting to know the OpenCitations project a little more, and learning the correct way to write a project abstract from [the guide from Emerald publishing offered in the course slides](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/how-to/authoring-editing-reviewing/write-article-abstract), we commenced writing the abstract for our project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/open-sci/2020-2021/blob/master/docs/TheLeftovers20/abstract.md). It was a challenging step, because we had to think about our project consciously and meticulously before having started getting our hands dirty."

    "During and after the class of 01/04/2021 (some of us were not present during the final hour because of a previously set exam) we created ORCID IDs for the group members. Afterwards, in the days preceding the lesson of the 8th, we created the Data Management Plan using the [OpenAIRE Argos Website](http://argos.openaire.eu/). We wrote the main explanations of the project all together in a group video call, and divided ourselves into two groups for inserting the data for each dataset. Sara and I put in the data for the dataset relating to the output data (titled _Missing Citations in COCI_). We all read some data on lesser-known fields to us such as licenses during the video call together.\n",

    "Meanwhile, we also started querying Crossref API service with some sample DOIs, so to be able to make some considerations about the amount and the quality of the data we are going to extract information from. During this step, we realised that the two alternative ways we worked out to retrieve information about publisher given a DOI seem to be in contrast. In particular, we noticed that - starting from a same DOI - the publisher that could be traced back to from the firs six characters of the identifier was not the same retrievable from the response of the Crossref API request. For this reason, we decided to ask for clarifications before proceeding."

    "At this point, we concretely structured the protocol for our workflow. For a matter of computational order, we preferred to address first the third research question (i.e. the one related to the previously invalid DOIs which can nowadays be re-labelled as valid). In relation to this point, we discussed how to manage the invalid_dois.csv file after this step, and whether the citations with now valid cited DOIs were supposed to be included in the further steps of the research, where we plan to identify publishers of both citing and cited DOIs. In order to find an optimal balance between computational cost and preservation of information that could be potentially useful for further analysis based on data we are handling, we decided to discuss this aspect with the course Professor Silvio Peroni before proceeding.\n",

However, after OpenCitations code analysis and some general tests on Crossref API service, Alessia and I mainly focused on the revision of the way we planned to implement research questions in light of some considerations arisen during our group meetings.\n"

    "As my colleagues proposed, I'd suggest to choose a license which is as clear and concise as possible, while staying permissive too. Since ISC and MIT are very close for their purposes and their differences don't seem to be so relevant in their factual application, I'd personally choose ISC because it is expressed with unequivocal language and therefore it can be understood by anyone, also with none or a very limited knowledge of the undelying legal background.\n",
    "However, MIT license makes explicit mention of sublicensing too, while ISC doesn't. Further, the slightly more complex structure of MIT could - to some extent - also facilitate the resolution of some doubts that could araise in particular circumstances.\n",

    "In accordance with the content of the material collected during the reviews’ analysis, we decided to refine both our protocol and – consequently – the steps planned for our software development. In order to define the passages in a detailed and unequivocal way, we created a flow diagram in draw.io, where we explained step-by-step the process from the input to the output material.\n",
    "In the creation of the diagram, we realised the necessity to make some further research about the mechanism to retrieve the publishers’ identifiers. At the end of this phase, we confirmed our decision of opting for a Crossref request, exploiting this base url : <a href =\"https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/\"> https://api.crossref.org/prefixes/</a>  + the first six digits of the doi of the publication of which we are trying to identify the publisher (e.g.: 10.1161).  \n",

    "Example:\n",
    "{\"status\":\"ok\",\"message-type\":\"prefix\",\"message-version\":\"1.0.0\",\"message\":{\"member\":\"http:\\/\\/id.crossref.org\\/member\\/276\",\"name\":\"Ovid Technologies (Wolters Kluwer Health)\",\"prefix\":\"http:\\/\\/id.crossref.org\\/prefix\\/10.1161\"}}\n",
    "\n",
    "This response is particularly useful for our purposes, since it provides both information about the publisher’s name and a confirmation of the validity of its code, i.e.: the identifier composed by the first six digits of the doi of the publication.\n",
    "Once the diagram was completed, we planned and realised the next update of our protocol. However, we all agreed it could not be the final version of the protocol itself, since we are planning to improve it after the finalization of the code."
