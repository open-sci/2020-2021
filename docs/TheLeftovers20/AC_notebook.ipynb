We wrote the main explanations of the project all together in a group video call, and divided ourselves into two groups for inserting the data for each dataset.

We all read some data on lesser-known fields to us such as licenses during the video call together.\n",

    "1. An introduction to the methodology with specification of the external services used by the methodology (if there is any) and a first draft of the passages which the methodology is composed of.\n",
    "2. a ‘before starting section’ with specification of the user requirements (first of all the programming language) for the reproducibility of our work and eventually common expressions and/or abbreviations.\n",
    "3. The core of the protocol: all the steps with title, sub-steps, description in natural language of the passages and better if accompanied by images or pieces of code to clarify them.\n",
    "4. Provide a schematic summarisation of the methodology. Among the all seen guidelines, the most effective seems to be the table form.\n",

    "1. the course slides, both the general part and the one dedicated to the protocols;\n",
