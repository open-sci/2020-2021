    "After reviewing the slides and getting to know the OpenCitations project a little more, and learning the correct way to write a project abstract from [the guide from Emerald publishing offered in the course slides](https://www.emeraldgrouppublishing.com/how-to/authoring-editing-reviewing/write-article-abstract), we commenced writing the abstract for our project, which can be found [here](https://github.com/open-sci/2020-2021/blob/master/docs/TheLeftovers20/abstract.md). It was a challenging step, because we had to think about our project consciously and meticulously before having started getting our hands dirty."

    "During and after the class of 01/04/2021 (some of us were not present during the final hour because of a previously set exam) we created ORCID IDs for the group members. Afterwards, in the days preceding the lesson of the 8th, we created the Data Management Plan using the [OpenAIRE Argos Website](http://argos.openaire.eu/). We wrote the main explanations of the project all together in a group video call, and divided ourselves into two groups for inserting the data for each dataset. Sara and I put in the data for the dataset relating to the output data (titled _Missing Citations in COCI_). We all read some data on lesser-known fields to us such as licenses during the video call together.\n",

    "Meanwhile, we also started querying Crossref API service with some sample DOIs, so to be able to make some considerations about the amount and the quality of the data we are going to extract information from. During this step, we realised that the two alternative ways we worked out to retrieve information about publisher given a DOI seem to be in contrast. In particular, we noticed that - starting from a same DOI - the publisher that could be traced back to from the firs six characters of the identifier was not the same retrievable from the response of the Crossref API request. For this reason, we decided to ask for clarifications before proceeding."

    "## Structuring The Protocol (12/04/2021 - 14/04/2021) <a class=\"anchor\" id=\"entry_8\"></a>\n",
    "At this point, we concretely structured the protocol for our workflow. For a matter of computational order, we preferred to address first the third research question (i.e. the one related to the previously invalid DOIs which can nowadays be re-labelled as valid). In relation to this point, we discussed how to manage the invalid_dois.csv file after this step, and whether the citations with now valid cited DOIs were supposed to be included in the further steps of the research, where we plan to identify publishers of both citing and cited DOIs. In order to find an optimal balance between computational cost and preservation of information that could be potentially useful for further analysis based on data we are handling, we decided to discuss this aspect with the course Professor Silvio Peroni before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this week we kept working mostly collegially, since we agreed that everyone of us should have a broad comprehension of all the aspects of the workflow before splitting it more markedly in the next phases. However, after OpenCitations code analysis and some general tests on Crossref API service, Alessia and I mainly focused on the revision of the way we planned to implement research questions in light of some considerations arisen during our group meetings. \n"
